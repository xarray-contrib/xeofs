Geographically weighted PCA
===========================
Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis (GWPCA) is a spatial analysis method that identifies and visualizes local spatial patterns and relationships in multivariate datasets across various geographic areas. It operates by applying PCA within a moving window over a geographical region, which enables the extraction of local principal components that can differ across locations.

TIn this demonstration, we'll apply GWPCA to a dataset detailing the chemical compositions of soils from countries around the Baltic Sea [1]_. This example is inspired by a tutorial originally crafted and published by Chris Brunsdon [2]_.
The dataset comprises 10 variables (chemical elements) and spans 768 samples.
Here, each sample refers to a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates, representing specific sampling stations.

.. note:: The dataset we're using is found in the R package
    `mvoutlier <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvoutlier/mvoutlier.pdf>`_.
    To access it, we'll employ the Python package
    `rpy2 <https://rpy2.github.io/doc/latest/html/index.html>`_ which facilitates
    interaction with R packages from within Python.

.. note:: Presently, there's no support for ``xarray.Dataset`` lacking an explicit feature dimension.
    As a workaround, ``xarray.DataArray.to_array`` can be used to convert the ``Dataset`` to an ``DataArray``.

.. warning:: Bear in mind that GWPCA requires significant computational power.
    The ``xeofs`` implementation is optimized for CPU efficiency and is best suited
    for smaller to medium data sets. For more extensive datasets where parallel processing becomes essential,
    it's advisable to turn to the R package `GWmodel <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel/GWmodel.pdf>`_.
    This package harnesses CUDA to enable GPU-accelerated GWPCA for optimized performance.


Let's import the necessary packages.

# Let's dive into the GWPCA. First, initialize a ``GWPCA`` instance and fit it to the data.
# The ``station`` dimension serves as our sample dimension, along which the local PCAs will be applied.
# Since these PCAs need to gauge distances to adjacent stations, we must specify
# a distance metric. Our station data includes coordinates in meters, so we'll
# choose the ``euclidean`` metric. If you have coordinates in degrees (like
# latitude and longitude), choose the ``haversine`` metric instead.
# We're also using a ``bisquare`` kernel with a bandwidth of 1000 km. Note that the
# bandwidth unit always follows input data (which is in meters here),
# except when using the ``haversine`` metric, which always gives distances in
# kilometers. Lastly, we'll standardize the input to ensure consistent scales
# for the chemical elements.
