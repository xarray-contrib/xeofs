However, there's an important difference: while `sklearn` `fit` method typically assumes 2D input data shaped as (`sample` x `feature`), our scenario is less straightforward. For any model, including PCA, we must specify the sample dimension. With this information, `xeofs` will interpret all other dimensions as feature dimensions.\n",
