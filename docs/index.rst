``xeofs`` is a specialized Python package designed for dimensionality reduction in climate science, aimed at extracting meaningful patterns from large datasets. It provides eigenmethods such as Principal Component Analysis (EOF analysis) and several related variants. Seamlessly integrated with ``xarray`` and ``Dask``, ``xeofs`` enables efficient handling and scalable computation of large, multi-dimensional datasets. This integration makes advanced climate data analysis both accessible and efficient.
