# Summary

`xeofs` is a Python package tailored for the climate science 
community, designed to streamline advanced data analysis using dimensionality 
reduction techniques like Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis &ndash; often
called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in other domains. 
Integrating seamlessly with `xarray` objects [@hoyer2017xarray], `xeofs` 
makes it easier to analyze large, labeled, multi-dimensional datasets.
By harnessing `Dask`'s capabilities [@dask2016], it scales computations efficiently
across multiple cores or clusters, apt for extensive climate data applications.


# Statement of Need
Climate science routinely deals with analyzing large, multi-dimensional datasets,
whose complexity mirrors the intricate dynamics of the climate system itself. The extraction of meaningful 
insights from such vast datasets is challenging and often requires the application
of dimensionality reduction techniques like EOF analysis (PCA outside climate science). 
Packages such as `scikit-learn` [@pedregosa_scikit-learn_2011]
offer a range of reduction techniques, yet they often fall short of meeting the 
specific needs of climate scientists who work with variants of PCA [@hannachi_patterns_2021] 
including ROCK-PCA [@bueso_nonlinear_2020] and spectral, rotated PCA [@guilloteau_rotated_2020].

Climate datasets are inherently multi-dimensional, usually involving time, longitude
and latitude, and often include missing values representing geographical features like 
oceans or land. These characteristics require meticulous data transformations and tracking 
of missing values and dimension coordinates, which can be cumbersome and prone to error, 
increasing the workload, especially for smaller-scale projects. Furthermore, the size 
of climate datasets often necessitates out-of-memory processing.

While `xMCA` [@xmca_yefee] and `eofs` [@dawson_eofs_2016] have addressed some of these 
issues by offering analysis tools compatible with `xarray` and `Dask`, `xeofs` 
expands on these by including a broader range of techniques such as 
rotated [@kaiser_varimax_1958], complex/Hilbert [@rasmusson_biennial_1981], and 
extended [@weare_examples_1982] PCA/EOF analysis. `xeofs` operates natively 
with `xarray` objects, preserving data labels and structure, and handles 
datasets with missing values adeptly. It also integrates seamlessly with `Dask`
and shows improved performance in particular for larger datasets 
(\autoref{fig:computation_times}) due to its usage of randomized 
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [@halko_finding_2011].

# Implementation
`xeofs` adopts the familiar `scikit-learn` style, delivering an intuitive interface 
where each method is a class with `fit`, and when applicable, `transform` 
and `inverse_transform` methods. It also offers flexibility by allowing users to 
introduce custom dimensionality reduction methods via a streamlined entry point 
to its internal pipeline. Additionally, the package includes a bootstrapping 
module for straightforward PCA model evaluation.
