	abstract = {Climate and weather constitute a typical example where high dimensional and complex phenomena meet. The atmospheric system is the result of highly complex interactions between many degrees of freedom or modes. In order to gain insight in understanding the dynamical/physical behaviour involved it is useful to attempt to understand their interactions in terms of a much smaller number of prominent modes of variability. This has led to the development by atmospheric researchers of methods that give a space display and a time display of large space-time atmospheric data. Empirical orthogonal functions ({EOFs}) were first used in meteorology in the late 1940s. The method, which decomposes a space-time field into spatial patterns and associated time indices, contributed much in advancing our knowledge of the atmosphere. However, since the atmosphere contains all sorts of features, e.g. stationary and propagating, {EOFs} are unable to provide a full picture. For example, {EOFs} tend, in general, to be difficult to interpret because of their geometric properties, such as their global feature, and their orthogonality in space and time. To obtain more localised features, modifications, e.g. rotated {EOFs} ({REOFs}), have been introduced. At the same time, because these methods cannot deal with propagating features, since they only use spatial correlation of the field, it was necessary to use both spatial and time information in order to identify such features. Extended and complex {EOFs} were introduced to serve that purpose. Because of the importance of {EOFs} and closely related methods in atmospheric science, and because the existing reviews of the subject are slightly out of date, there seems to be a need to update our knowledge by including new developments that could not be presented in previous reviews. This review proposes to achieve precisely this goal. The basic theory of the main types of {EOFs} is reviewed, and a wide range of applications using various data sets are also provided.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11411},
	abstract = {Spectral {PCA} ({sPCA}), in contrast to classical {PCA}, offers the advantage of identifying organized spatiotemporal patterns within speciﬁc frequency bands and extracting dynamical modes. However, the unavoidable tradeoff between frequency resolution and robustness of the {PCs} leads to high sensitivity to noise and overﬁtting, which limits the interpretation of the {sPCA} results. We propose herein a simple non-parametric implementation of the {sPCA} using the continuous analytic Morlet wavelet as a robust estimator of the cross-spectral matrices with good frequency resolution. To improve the interpretability of the results when several modes of similar amplitude exist within the same frequency band, we propose a rotation of eigenvectors that optimizes the spatial smoothness in the phase domain. The developed method, called rotated spectral {PCA} ({rsPCA}), is tested on synthetic data simulating propagating waves and shows impressive performance even with high levels of noise in the data. Applied to historical sea surface temperature ({SST}) time series over the Paciﬁc Ocean, the method accurately captures the El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) at low frequency (2 to 7 years periodicity). At high frequencies (sub-annual periodicity), at which several extratropical patterns of similar amplitude are identiﬁed, the {rsPCA} successfully unmixes the underlying modes, revealing spatially coherent patterns with robust propagation dynamics. Identiﬁcation of higher frequency space-time climate modes holds promise for seasonal to subseasonal prediction and for diagnostic analysis of climate models.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing observations, products and simulations are fundamental sources of information to monitor our planet and its climate variability. Uncovering the main modes of spatial and temporal variability in Earth data is essential to analyze and understand the underlying physical dynamics and processes driving the Earth System. Dimensionality reduction methods can work with spatio-temporal datasets and decompose the information efficiently. Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}), also known as Empirical Orthogonal Functions ({EOF}) in geophysics, has been traditionally used to analyze climatic data. However, when nonlinear feature relations are present, {PCA}/{EOF} fails. In this work, we propose a nonlinear {PCA} method to deal with spatio-temporal Earth System data. The proposed method, called Rotated Complex Kernel {PCA} ({ROCK}-{PCA} for short), works in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to account for nonlinear processes, operates in the complex kernel domain to account for both space and time features, and adds an extra rotation for improved flexibility. The result is an explicitly resolved spatio-temporal decomposition of the Earth data cube. The method is unsupervised and computationally very efficient.We illustrate its ability to uncover spatio-temporal patterns using synthetic experiments and real data. Results of the decomposition of three essential climate variables are shown: satellite-based global Gross Primary Productivity ({GPP}) and Soil Moisture ({SM}), and reanalysis Sea Surface Temperature ({SST}) data. The {ROCK}-{PCA} method allows identifying their annual and seasonal oscillations, as well as their non-seasonal trends and spatial variability patterns.},

These time series are derived from four mooring arrays located on the western boundary of the North Atlantic: the {RAPID} Western Atlantic Variability Experiment ({WAVE}) array (42.5°N), the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Line W array (39°N), {RAPID}–{MOC}/{MOCHA} (26.5°N), and the Meridional Overturning Variability Experiment ({MOVE}) array (16°N). Using modal decompositions of the analytic cross-correlation between transports and wind stress, the basin-scale wind stress is shown to significantly drive the {MOC} coherently at four latitudes, on the time scales available for this study. The dominant mode of covariance is interpreted as rapid barotropic oceanic adjustments to wind stress forcing, eventually forming two counterrotating Ekman overturning cells centered on the tropics and subtropical gyre. A second mode of covariance appears related to patterns of wind stress and wind stress curl associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, spinning anomalous horizontal circulations that likely interact with topography to form overturning cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract A proper description of ocean–atmosphere interactions is key for a correct understanding of climate evolution. The interplay among the different variables acting over the climate is complex, often leading to correlations across long spatial distances (teleconnections). On some occasions, those teleconnections occur with quite significant temporal shifts that are fundamental for the understanding of the underlying phenomena but that are poorly captured by standard methods. Applying orthogonal decomposition such as maximum covariance analysis ({MCA}) to geophysical datasets allows us to extract common dominant patterns between two different variables, but generally suffers from (i) the nonphysical orthogonal constraint as well as (ii) the consideration of simple correlations, whereby temporally offset signals are not detected. Here we propose an extension, complex rotated {MCA}, to address both limitations. We transform our signals using the Hilbert transform and perform the orthogonal decomposition in complex space, allowing us to correctly correlate out-of-phase signals. Subsequent varimax rotation removes the orthogonal constraints, leading to more physically meaningful modes of geophysical variability. As an example, we have employed this method on sea surface temperature and continental precipitation; our method successfully captures the temporal and spatial interactions between these two variables for (i) the seasonal cycle, (ii) canonical {ENSO}, (iii) the global warming trend, (iv) the Pacific decadal oscillation, (v) {ENSO} Modoki, and finally (vi) the Atlantic meridional mode. The complex rotated modes of {MCA} provide information on the regional amplitude and, under certain conditions, the regional time lag between changes on ocean temperature and land precipitation.},

Two examples of applications of this technique are given which suggest it may be a highly useful tool for diagnosing the modes of variation of dominant sequences of events. In the first, an analysis of 300 mb relative vorticity, fairly regular advection of the major features of the spatial patterns is evident. Westward speeds of between 0.3 and 0.4 m s−1 are inferred. The second example illustrates extended functions of tropical Pacific Ocean surface temperatures. The dominant function, which is associated with El Niño, shows a high degree of persistence over a six-month sequence. The second most important function suggests opposing variations in the influences of the North and South Pacific Equatorial Currents.},

	abstract = {Abstract The time history of the Monsoon System over the Indian Ocean has been developed from ship observations and merged with the Wyrtki-Meyers Pacific Trade Wind field. The interaction of these two massive wind systems has been studied by a rather new empirical orthogonal function ({EOF}) analysis capable of detecting propagating features in the wind systems. The current study (Part I) was confined to variations within ±10° of the equator. Results show the two wind systems are strongly coupled at interannual time scales. The coupling is effected through cyclostationary pulsations and longitudinal shifts of the huge surface convergence over Indonesia. The interaction may also he thought of as the spatial expansion/contraction of the wind systems. These changes can be viewed as the transition of the Monsoon/Trade Winds between two preferred climate states. One sub-element of this apparent bimodality in the wind fields is the El Niño phenomenon. The zonal component of the combined wind fields seems to instigate the large-scale interaction noted above. Perturbations in the u-component are composed of two interesting elements. One is a traveling disturbance which moves from the Indian Ocean eastward into the Pacific, and has many features of an equatorially trapped Kelvin wave. The second is a standing wave pattern which has maxima in the Indian and western Pacific with a node over Indonesia (the Walker cell). Thew perturbations preceed El Niño events and are phase-locked to the seasonal cycle. Their time variation can be viewed as a frequency-modulated process. A quasi-biennial oscillation appears in both wind fields as a standing wave pattern with in-phase maxima off the cast coast of Africa and west cost of South America. Subsequent papers will describe the interaction of the Monsoon/Trade Winds system in the band ±30° of the equator (Part {II}) and, in Part {III}, build a mechanistic, physical picture for the results obtained in Parts I and {II}.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper documents the low-frequency (i.e., decadal) variations of surface temperature for the period 1899–1998 in observations, and in simulations conducted as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) Fourth Assessment Report ({AR}4). The space–time structure of low-frequency variations is extracted using optimal persistence analysis, which is a technique that linearly decomposes a vector time series into a set of uncorrelated components, ordered such that the first component maximizes the decorrelation time, the second maximizes the decorrelation time subject to being uncorrelated with the first, and so on. The results suggests that only the first two optimal persistence patterns ({OPPs}) in the observation-based record are statistically distinguishable from white noise. These two components can reproduce the spatial structure of local linear trends over various multidecadal periods, indicating that they give an efficient representation of the observed change in surface temperature. In contrast, most simulations suggest the existence of a single physically significant {OPP}, all with qualitatively similar time series but each with somewhat different spatial structure. The leading {OPP} computed from the full model grid is surprisingly consistent with the leading {OPP} computed from the observation-based grid with missing data masked out, suggesting that the observation-based grid does not pose a serious barrier to extracting the dominant low-frequency variations in the global climate system. The regions in which the leading optimal persistence patterns agree in their predictions of warming coincides with the regions in which warming has in fact been observed to occur.},

	abstract = {Abstract A technique is described for determining the set of patterns in a time-varying field whose corresponding time series remain correlated for the longest times. The basic idea is to obtain patterns that, when projected on a time-varying field, produce time series that optimize a measure of decorrelation time. The decorrelation time is measured by one of the integrals where τ is the time lag and ρτ is the correlation function of the time series. These integrals arise naturally in sampling theory and power spectra analysis. Moreover, these integrals define the maximum lead time beyond which linear prediction models lose all forecast skill. Thus, an optimally persistent pattern is interesting because it optimizes a quantity that is of fundamental and practical importance. An orthogonal set of time series that optimize these integrals can be obtained from the lagged covariance matrix of the dataset. The corresponding patterns, called optimal persistence patterns ({OPPs}), may provide a useful basis set for statistical prediction models, because they may remain correlated for much longer periods than individual empirical orthogonal functions ({EOFs}). The main shortcoming of {OPPs} is that they are sensitive to sampling errors. To reduce the sensitivity, the upper limit of integration and the basis set used to define the pattern need to be as small as possible, yet large enough to resolve the space–time structure of the pattern. Examples of {OPPs} are presented for the Lorenz model and the daily anomaly 500-{hPa} geopotential height fields. In the case of the Lorenz model, the technique is shown to be far superior at capturing persistent, oscillatory signals than other techniques. As for geopotential height, the technique reveals that the absolute longest decorrelation time, in the space spanned by the first few dozen {EOFs}, is 12–15 days. It is perhaps noteworthy that this time is virtually identical to the theoretical limit of atmospheric predictability determined in previous studies. This result suggests that the monthly anomaly in this state space, which is often used to study long-term climate variability, arises not from a perturbation that lasts for a month, but rather from a few “episodes” often lasting less than 2 weeks. Depending on the number of {EOFs} and on which measure of decorrelation time is considered, the leading {OPP} resembles the Arctic oscillation. The second {OPP} is associated with an apparent discontinuity around March 1977. The {OPP} that minimizes decorrelation time (the “trailing {OPP}”) is associated with synoptic eddies along storm tracks. The technique not only finds persistent signals in stationary data, but also finds trends, discontinuities, and other low-frequency signals in nonstationary data. Indeed, for datasets containing both a random component and a nonstationary component, maximizing decorrelation time is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of low-frequency variations. The technique is especially attractive in this regard because it is very efficient and requires no preconceived notion about the form of the nonstationary signal.},

	shorttitle = {Finding Structure with Randomness},
	abstract = {In many applications, the data consist of (or may be naturally formulated as) an \$m {\textbackslash}times n\$ matrix A. It is often of interest to find a low-rank approximation to A, i.e., an approximation D to the matrix A of rank not greater than a specified rank k, where k is much smaller than m and n. Methods such as the singular value decomposition ({SVD}) may be used to find an approximation to A which is the best in a well-defined sense. These methods require memory and time which are superlinear in m and n; for many applications in which the data sets are very large this is prohibitive. Two simple and intuitive algorithms are presented which, when given an \$m {\textbackslash}times n\$ matrix A, compute a description of a low-rank approximation \$D{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$ to A, and which are qualitatively faster than the {SVD}. Both algorithms have provable bounds for the error matrix \$A-D{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$. For any matrix X, let \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}\{X\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_F\$ and \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}\{X\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_2\$ denote its Frobenius norm and its spectral norm, respectively. In the first algorithm, c columns of A are randomly chosen. If the \$m {\textbackslash}times c\$ matrix C consists of those c columns of A (after appropriate rescaling), then it is shown that from \$C{\textasciicircum}{TC}\$ approximations to the top singular values and corresponding singular vectors may be computed. From the computed singular vectors a description \$D{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$ of the matrix A may be computed such that \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{rank\}(D{\textasciicircum}\{*\}) {\textbackslash}le k\$ and such that \$\$ {\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}{\textbar}A-D{\textasciicircum}\{*\}{\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}xi\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}min\_\{D:{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rank\}(D){\textbackslash}le k\} {\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}{\textbar}A-D{\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}xi\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} + poly(k,1/c) {\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\{A\}{\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\_F \$\$ holds with high probability for both \${\textbackslash}xi = 2,F\$. This algorithm may be implemented without storing the matrix A in random access memory ({RAM}), provided it can make two passes over the matrix stored in external memory and use \$O(cm+c{\textasciicircum}2)\$ additional {RAM}. The second algorithm is similar except that it further approximates the matrix C by randomly sampling r rows of C to form a \$r {\textbackslash}times c\$ matrix W. Thus, it has additional error, but it can be implemented in three passes over the matrix using only constant additional {RAM}. To achieve an additional error (beyond the best rank k approximation) that is at most \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\{A\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\_F\$, both algorithms take time which is polynomial in k, \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\$, and \${\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}delta)\$, where \${\textbackslash}delta{\textgreater}0\$ is a failure probability; the first takes time linear in \${\textbackslash}mbox\{max\}(m,n)\$ and the second takes time independent of m and n. Our bounds improve previously published results with respect to the rank parameter k for both the Frobenius and spectral norms. In addition, the proofs for the error bounds use a novel method that makes important use of matrix perturbation theory. The probability distribution over columns of A and the rescaling are crucial features of the algorithms which must be chosen judiciously.},
